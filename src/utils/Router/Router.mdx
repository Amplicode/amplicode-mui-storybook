# Router

React Router is a multi-strategy router for React bridging the gap from React 18 to React 19.

You can use it maximally as a React framework or as minimally as you want.

<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<div>Page</div>} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

## useNavigate

Returns a function that lets you navigate programmatically in the browser in response to user interactions or effects.

Available as VsCode completion. Keywords: "nav", "navigate", "link", "goto".

```
  const navigate = useNavigate();
```
